Bank TD Analysis and Descriptive Analysis

Overview

Welcome to my latest project, which focuses on data analysis using Python. This project is designed to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and extracting actionable insights. With a combination of powerful libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I explored a dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and meaningful conclusions.

Key Features

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured the dataset was analysis-ready.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends, correlations, and distributions to extract meaningful insights.

Actionable Insights: Derived conclusions based on data to provide value-driven recommendations.

Tools and Technologies

Python: Core programming language used for analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding environment.

Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualization.

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository.

Open the Untitled.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Insights

(List a couple of significant findings from the project.)

Example: "Clients with higher account balances are more likely to subscribe to term deposits."
Based on the historical data, following clients should be prioritized for future campaigns 
    # 1. age between 30-40 
    # 2. white and blue collar job peoples and retired citizens 
    # 3.married and single people should have priority 
    # 4.secondary and tertiary educated people should have target   
    # 5.zero bank ballance indivisual have high rate of accepting TD bank should avoid that to avoid risk of   
          Premature Withdrawal in emergency situation 
    # 6. customers with any loan have high chanses of accepting TD bank should promote that indivisuals and  
       avoid indivisual with loan in order to secure future risk
